 ### Summary:
 
 ![plot1](Images/summary_dataframe.png)

The data analysis indicates that there are fewer rural users for PyBer.
The average fare per ride is highest for the rural rides.
This may be a factor for less rural users.
   * If the company can provide discount then there will be more rural users.  
 
From the analysis, the number of drivers is less in the rural area 
This might have caused longer waiting time which would have discouraged the users. 
  * By increasing number of drivers this can be improved.
  
  * The travel distance may be the factor, to determine other factors that are 
 contributing to the high ride costs in rural cities and low driver fares in urban cities.
