# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:

This analysis is to identify any disparity in ride data between different city types. The ride data has fare, driver count, city types per each ride for a year.
Summary statistics was calculated different aspects and weekly data was visualized to identify the disparity.





## Results after analysing the PyBer Challenge data with the two deliverables:


### The findings from analyzing ride-sharing data:

* Rural has the lowest number of total rides, drivers, and total fare. But it has highest average fares per ride and average fare per driver.

* Urban has the highest number of total rides, drivers and total fares with lowest average fares per ride and average fare per driver.
 
* Suburban is in between Rural and Urban with the results of the total rides, drivers, total fares, averages of fare-per ride and fare-per driver.
  
 From the above results, it is clear that most of PyBer's revenue occurs in Urban cities. 
 
 
  
 ### Summary:

1. The data analysis indicates that there are fewer rural users for PyBer.
The average fare per ride is highest for the rural rides. This may be a factor for less rural users. 
   * If the company can provide discount then there will be more rural users.  
 
2. From the analysis, the number of drivers is less in the rural area. This might have caused longer waiting time which would have discouraged the users. 
   *  By increasing number of drivers this can be improved.
  
   *  The travel distance may be the factor, to determine other factors that are 
 contributing to the high ride costs in rural cities and low driver fares in urban cities.
 
 3. By seeing the below line chart, we can conclude the total fare remains stable periodically.
